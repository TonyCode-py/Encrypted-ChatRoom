# Simple_ChatRoom
This a simple E2E encrypted chat room based on socket. The message is encrypted by rsa 1024. (If you want , you can change it to 2048 or higher.) The key is generated randomly every time you run the client. Only you have the keys. So it can strongly protect your privacy.Anyone else can not see the message you send.

How to use?
1. install all the necessary libs
2. run the server and input the ip of the computer which you want to use as a server
3. run the client and input the server ip
4. register an account and login to chat with others

Now it can only spport group chat. The single chat will be added later.
